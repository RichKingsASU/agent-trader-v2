# Social Intelligence

## Intent
Define interfaces for transforming social content streams into structured features (momentum, narrative clusters, influencer effects) with strong provenance and safety constraints.

## Non-goals (for this vNEXT skeleton)
- Scraping/social platform integrations
- Real-time streaming consumers
- Moderation policy enforcement implementation

## Deliverables in this module
- `interfaces.py`: Contract-only placeholders (no runtime behavior).
- `__init__.py`: Empty package marker.

## Constraints
- No imports from existing live systems under `backend/`.
- No execution logic, side effects, network calls, or persistence.

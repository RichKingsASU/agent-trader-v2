# Temporary allowlist for requirements pinning gate.
#
# Policy target: all requirements should ultimately be pinned with '==' (or use
# a direct reference with '@'). Until that migration is complete, this allowlist
# permits specific packages/lines to remain unpinned without blocking CI.
#
# Entries can be either:
# - a base package name (e.g. "requests")
# - an exact requirement line (e.g. "pydantic>=2.0.0,<3.0.0")

# backend/* services (currently unpinned)
